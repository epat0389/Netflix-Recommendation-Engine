## Overview
Designed a recommendation engine for Netflix to personalize viewing suggestions based on user behavior. Utilizing data from 2000 subscribers across 9 shows, I analyzed viewing patterns using Excel to create a correlation matrix, which identified relationships between shows watched. This engine helps enhance user engagement by recommending shows with similar viewing statistics, thereby improving customer retention.
